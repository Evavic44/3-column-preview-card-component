## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom styling
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt that with CSS Grid, you can build multiple and complex layouts. Which is what I implemented in this challenge. 

### Continued development
Moving ahead I'll be focusing on reinforcing my CSS grid abilities, because I find it easier to build layouts with it than flexbox. I aslo have a target to finish all newbie frontendmentor challenges.
